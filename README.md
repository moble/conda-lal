## NOTE: ##

This project is no longer being developed.  I never quite got it working, as the public instructions were much to complicated and contradictory, with some necessary code versions being private to LVC members.

There is a [docker image](https://ligo-cbc.github.io/pycbc/latest/html/docker.html) that's supposedly publicly available, and looks like it's maintained reasonably well.

The rest of this repo (including this README) is just what I had gotten working before I gave up.

Installing LAL's python packages
================================

The usual instructions for `pycbc` are
[here](http://ligo-cbc.github.io/pycbc/latest/html/install.html).
They are long, and nested.  This is (hopefully) an easier option.


## TL-DR ##

Install [`anaconda`](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and run this:
```bash
conda install -c moble pycbc
```


## Full instructions ##

### Install Anaconda ###

[Install `anaconda` here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Your system python is old and crusty, but it needs to be that way or
your printer might break.  Your package manager needs its own version
of python to support that weird OCR package you want, or whatever it
is this week.  But you---when running straight python on its own---you
want a separate up-to-date version of python to
run fancy new code with.  And most of all you want to minimize the
headaches that usually go along with managing python.

The answer is `anaconda`, which is a python manager developed by the
guy behind `numpy` (and a lot of `scipy`).  He decided that it was
just too much hassle maintaining those big, complex packages with
existing python tools like `pip` and `setuptools`, so he created
`anaconda`.  Scientific python developers have now almost uniformly
adopted this as the way to use python, because there's no better way
to manage python packages.

`Anaconda` installs in your user directory, so you can use it on
clusters just as easily as on your laptop, and it doesn't get mixed up
with your OS or package-manager versions of python.  Outside of its
own directory, the only change it (optionally!) makes is to prepend
its `bin` directory to your `PATH` in your `~/.bashrc` file.

Note that you *should not use* `PYTHONPATH` or similar environment
variables.  Python can still get confused by that occasionally, even
with `anaconda`, so make sure it is not set.


### Create a `conda` environment just for this ###

Since `pycbc` apparently doesn't work with newer versions of python,
you need to do this step if you installed the python 3.5 version of
`anaconda`.  This step is optional if you installed the python 2.7
version, but it might still be nice to contain LAL's dependencies in
one environment.  An analogous thing is also recommended (using the
outdated `virtualenv`) in the `pycbc` installation instructions.  To
create and activate the environment, do this:

```bash
conda create -y --name lal python=2.7
source activate lal
conda update -y --all
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Now, your current shell will always use python-y things from this
environment only.  Other shells will not be affected.  And you can get
out of this environment in the current shell just by running
`source deactivate` at any time.

Be sure to run `source activate lal` in any new shell before you try
using or installing in this environment.

### Populate the environment with basic packages ###

Whether or not you created the `lal` environment above, you should run
this command:

```bash
conda install -y numpy h5py cython
pip install python-cjson
conda install -y -c moble fftw gsl libframe libmetaio glue lscsoft-user-env lalsuite

unittest2
```


To build any of these packages yourself, you should first do

```bash
conda install -y anaconda-build
```

conda build --python 2.7 .
